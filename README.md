# Vulnerability Buffet
The Vulnerability Buffet is a website, built in ASP.NET Core, designed for two purposes:

1. To have an apples-to-apples comparison between scans done by multiple scanners and multiple types of scanners (i.e. DAST, SAST, and Vulnerability scanners).
2. To allow developers to learn how attacks are done and to show how some mitigation methods can fall short.

The list of vulnerabilities isn't comprehensive (yet), so I'll be making updates as I have time. In the meantime, if you have any you want to add, please feel free to make a pull request.
