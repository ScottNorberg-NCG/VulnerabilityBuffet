    <p>This site was built by <a href="https://norbergconsultinggroup.com" target="_blank">Norberg Consulting Group, LLC.</a> as a way to test various scanners against one another.</p>
    <p>However, we built it in such a way that people learning security can examine each page and see what the vulnerability is (or vulnerabilities ar) on that page to learn security or do your own scanning.</p>
    <p>Source for the nutrition data is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GTQg3GlTCT9_x96t3KCxmHqje9wGZELUoHvAo-QROSk/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">here</a>. All calories per 100 grams of food.</p>
